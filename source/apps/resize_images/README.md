# Resize Image with JavaScript

Google Photos is missing this function (or at least I cannot find it)
to scale an image.
So now i can just open this page in my browser and select my image  resize it and download it.
Better than installing one of those 'free' apps with intrusive advertisements that try and trick you into giving them permissions.
